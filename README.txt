Fun Interpreter and Compiler  
    Created an interpreter then compiler for a basic language called 'Fun'. 
    This interpreter took in 'fun' code and outputted the apropiate output. 
    This compiler took in 'fun' code and outputted X86-64 assembly. The compiler has constant folding and trail recursion optimization.
    The 'fun' language included expression parsing, print statements, if statements, while loops, function calls, parameters, return statements, and global/local scoping.

Coroutines
    Created cooperative scheduling between coroutines using register, stack pointer, and instruction pointer manipulation.

Pipelined Processor
    Created pipelined processor in verilog to run a simple Turing-complete instruction set.
    Added support for misaligned memory writes/reads, self modifying code, writebacks, and pipeline flushing.
    Created saturating branch predictor to predict jumps statements.
